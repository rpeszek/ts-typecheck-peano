This is how Peano numbers will be encoded:

My actuall test.

The code type annotates all 'RHS'-s to show what type checker agrees with 
and the code is commented out when it fails to type check.

The type level `L extends Succ<infer Lprev>` is hard to write code for but I managed with `in` 
because all my values are JS objects (e.g. Zero is not "zero"). 

Type checker figured out that the argument `l` is actually a successor of `Lprev`. 

I am providing a hacked `addSucc` helper that returns `Succ<Add<Lprev, R>>` this is exactly the first type in the type level 
ternary definition of 'Add'!!  

I am returning what the `Add` conditional type definition wants.  Yet the type-checker does not see it and will not unify it 
with `Add<L,R>`.  

The `else` case is where the type level ternary condition fails so I am supposed to return `R`, and I do!
But, again the type checker does not realize that, and I have to cast it!
